I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I have a passion for technology and enjoy learning about the innovative ways to protect something that has quickly become part of the backbone of our world. 💻 This has led me to further my education in cybersecurity with the intention to one day soon start my career as a Security Analyst within a Security Operations Center.
